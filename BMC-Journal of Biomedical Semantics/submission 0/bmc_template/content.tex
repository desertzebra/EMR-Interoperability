In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]=
\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
\begin{aligned}[b]
&      E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]\\
&\quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
